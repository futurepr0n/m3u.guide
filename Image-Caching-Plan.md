# Image Caching System Enhancement Plan

## Problem Statement
- Large playlists with many channel logos cause slow loading in edit mode
- All images are fetched directly from external URLs every time
- Need to cache images locally while preserving original URLs in M3U files
- Current implementation in playlist editor loads all logos simultaneously, blocking UI

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Image Loading Locations
1. **Playlist Editor** (`static/js/playlist-editor.js:95-108`)
   - Extracts `tvg-logo` URLs from EXTINF lines
   - Creates `<img>` elements with direct external URLs
   - No caching or lazy loading implemented

2. **Content Analysis Reports** (generated by `m3u_analyzer_beefy.py`)
   - HTML reports reference external logo URLs
   - Large playlists generate reports with hundreds of external image requests

3. **M3U Processing** (`app.py:751-760`)
   - Extracts logo URLs during playlist parsing
   - Stores in channel objects but doesn't cache images

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Directory Structure Enhancement
```
static/playlists/{user_id}/{playlist_name}/
├── tv.m3u                    # Original M3U (URLs unchanged)
├── epg.xml
├── logos/                    # NEW: Local image cache
│   ├── cached_images.json    # Image URL to filename mapping
│   ├── abc_news_logo.png
│   ├── espn_logo.jpg
│   └── ...
├── analysis/
└── optimized/
```

### 2. Core Components

#### A. ImageCacheManager Class (new utility: `utils/image_cache.py`)
```python
class ImageCacheManager:
    def cache_channel_logos(playlist_path, user_id, playlist_name)
    def get_cached_logo_url(original_url, user_id, playlist_name)
    def download_and_cache_image(url, cache_dir)
    def cleanup_unused_images(playlist_path, cache_dir)
    def generate_cache_filename(url)  # Hash-based naming
    def load_cache_mapping(cache_dir)
    def save_cache_mapping(cache_dir, mapping)
```

#### B. Enhanced Routes
- `/api/cache-logos` - Background logo caching endpoint
- `/static/playlists/{user_id}/{playlist_name}/logos/{filename}` - Serve cached images
- `/api/cache-status/{playlist_name}` - Check cache completion status

#### C. Frontend Enhancements (`static/js/image-loader.js`)
```javascript
class ImageLoader {
    loadChannelLogo(originalUrl, userId, playlistName, imgElement)
    checkCacheStatus(userId, playlistName)
    fallbackToOriginal(imgElement, originalUrl)
    lazyLoadImages(container)
}
```

### 3. Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Basic Caching Infrastructure
1. **Create ImageCacheManager utility class**
   - Image downloading with proper error handling
   - File naming strategy (SHA-256 hash of URL + original extension)
   - Metadata JSON for URL-to-filename mapping
   - Support for common image formats (jpg, png, gif, webp)

2. **Enhance playlist processing**
   - During `process_playlist()`, trigger background logo caching
   - Update `analyze_playlist()` to cache any new logos found
   - Add cache status to playlist database model

3. **Add cache serving routes**
   - Secure route to serve cached images with proper authorization
   - Content-type headers and browser caching directives
   - Fallback handling for missing cached images

#### Phase 2: Editor Integration
1. **Modify playlist editor JavaScript**
   - Replace direct logo URL usage with cache-aware loading
   - Implement lazy loading with intersection observer
   - Add loading placeholders and error fallbacks
   - Progressive enhancement (works without cache)

2. **Update analysis HTML generation**
   - Use cached images in content analysis reports
   - Maintain original URLs in downloadable M3U files
   - Add cache warming during analysis generation

#### Phase 3: Performance Optimizations
1. **Background processing**
   - Asynchronous logo downloading to avoid blocking UI
   - Concurrent downloads with rate limiting (max 5 simultaneous)
   - Progress tracking and user feedback

2. **Cache management**
   - Automatic cleanup of unused images when playlists are deleted
   - Cache size monitoring and configurable limits
   - Cache refresh strategies (TTL-based or manual)

### 4. Key Features

#### Playlist Integrity Preservation
- ✅ Original M3U files keep external logo URLs unchanged
- ✅ Only internal app views (editor, analysis) use cached images
- ✅ Exported/downloaded playlists maintain source URLs
- ✅ m3u-epg-editor integration unaffected

#### Performance Improvements
- ✅ Instant logo loading in editor after first cache
- ✅ Reduced external HTTP requests (500+ logos → 0 after cache)
- ✅ Lazy loading prevents UI blocking on large playlists
- ✅ Graceful fallback to original URLs if cache fails

#### Future-Ready Architecture
- ✅ User-specific caching (Phase 1)
- ✅ Global deduplication ready (Phase 2 future enhancement)
- ✅ Configurable cache strategies and limits
- ✅ Analytics on cache hit rates and performance gains

#### Modified Files
```
app.py                          # Add caching routes and integrate with processing
static/js/playlist-editor.js    # Use cached images in editor

```

#### Database Schema Changes
```python
# Add to Playlist model
cached_logos_count = db.Column(db.Integer, default=0)
cache_last_updated = db.Column(db.DateTime)
cache_status = db.Column(db.String(20), default='pending')  # pending, processing, completed, error
```

### 6. Configuration Options

#### Cache Settings (environment variables or config file)
```python
LOGO_CACHE_MAX_SIZE_MB = 500      # Max cache size per playlist
LOGO_CACHE_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB = 5   # Max individual file size
LOGO_CACHE_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS = 5
LOGO_CACHE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 10   # seconds
LOGO_CACHE_TTL_DAYS = 30         # Cache refresh period
LOGO_CACHE_ENABLED = True        # Feature toggle
```

#### Image Processing Options
```python
LOGO_CACHE_CONVERT_TO_WEBP = False  # Convert images to WebP for efficiency
LOGO_CACHE_MAX_DIMENSION = 200      # Resize large logos
LOGO_CACHE_QUALITY = 85             # Compression quality
```

### 7. Error Handling & Edge Cases

#### Network Issues
- Timeout handling for slow image downloads
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Graceful fallback to original URLs

#### Storage Management
- Disk space monitoring and alerts
- Automatic cleanup of old/unused cache entries
- Cache corruption detection and recovery

#### Security Considerations
- Validate image file types and content
- Prevent cache directory traversal attacks
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- User isolation (users can't access other users' cached images)

### 8. Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- ImageCacheManager functionality
- URL hashing and filename generation
- Cache mapping persistence

#### Integration Tests
- End-to-end caching workflow
- Playlist editor with cached images
- Cache serving routes

#### Performance Tests

- Memory usage with large playlists
- Concurrent user cache operations

### 9. Monitoring & Analytics

#### Cache Performance Metrics
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Average image load times
- Storage usage per user/playlist
- Failed download tracking

#### User Experience Metrics
- Editor load time improvements
- Image loading error rates
- User-reported performance issues

### 10. Future Enhancements (Phase 2+)

#### Global Image Deduplication
```
